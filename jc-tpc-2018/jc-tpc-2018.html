.footnote[TPC Glasgow 2018]

---

# A bit about me

- Been programming since the '80s
- Perl since the late '90s
- Also worked with C, PHP, Python, Lua..
- Did a lot of system administration / devops (before it was called that)
  - Mainly Linux
  - Also worked with Solaris, SCO Unix, AIX, Ultrix.. 
- Worked with Mysql, PostreSQL, Orcacle, ..

---

# A bit about Strato

  - Shared, Virtual, Dedicated, etc.
- Been around for 20+ years
  - Lots of legacy code and systems
    - Oracle, Sybase, Solaris..
  - Lots of Perl
  - Lots of self-built solutions
    - for example own KV store (dbmd)
- Part of the United Internet Group since 2017
  - 1&amp;1

---

# Orchestration Workflow Example

__Ordering a Wordpress Package on Shared Webhosting__

- Allocate storage (filer)
  - May determine IP number
- Configure DNS (nameserver)
  - With the IP number from the previous step
- Register Domain (EPP client)
- Configure Vhost (apache)
  - May be dependent on storage location
- Allocate Mysql Database
  - May also be dependent on storage location
- Install Wordpress
- Configure Wordpress

---

# How it used to be..

*(and mostly still is)*

- lots ad-hoc state machines
  - state transition logic buried deep in the scripts
  - often spread over multiple scripts
  - most state is stored in *the* database
    - but some might be somewhere else
- mostly cronjobs
  - depending on cron-schedule some things can take hours
  - horrible hacks to speed things up (procmail..)

---

# Wouldn't it be nice if..

- we had some easy way to model state machines
- we could store the workflow logic in some central place
- we could introspect running jobs in some standard way
- etc.

---

# JobCenter Design Criteria

- Database as central storage
  - The state machine transition table is stored there
  - Current state is stored there
  - Every state transition is logged there
  - "Crash-Proof"
- Job state should be easily inspectable
  - Everything is JSON
- It should be relatively easy to 'meddle' with a Job
  - update jobs set ... where job_id=...
- Relatively "Lightweight" and "Simple"
- Written in our favourite language
- Open Source

---

# Some JobCenter terminology

- A Workflow is a state machine transition table
  - or a program for the JobCenter virtual machine
- Actions are the possible instructions
  - external (done by a worker)
  - internal (if, while, etc)
  - workflow ('function')
  - procedure
- Actions have declared 'inputs' and 'outputs'
  - using JSON Schemas
- A Workflow is (also) an Action
  - workflows as subroutines

---

# Some more terminology

- A Task is an Action in a Workflow
  - an instruction in a program
- A Job is an instance of a Workflow
  - executing the program
- A Child Job is a workflow that was called from another workflow
  - next 'stack frame' for a subroutine
- A Worker is an external entity capable of performing one of more Actions
  
---
# A bit about Job state

.nomargin[
A running job has:
]
- a "current task" ("current instruction")
- arguments (ro)
- variables (rw)
- task state

All job state is persistent.
___

Per task state sequence:
<img src="task states.svg" width="100%">

???

- timestamps
- stepcounter
- ...

---

# The JobCenter Language (JCL)

.nomargin[
a custom workflow modelling language:
]
- intended to look and feel like a somewhat 'normal' programming language
- easy to version control
- easy to diff
- compiled using the `jcc` compiler
  - compiled form is stored in the database

---

# Basic JCL example

```
workflow calltest:
in:
        input number
out:
        output number
wfomap:
        output = v.thing
do:
        call add:
                counter = a.input
                step = 3
        into:
                thing = o.counter
```

- "input mapping" is calculating the subroutine arguments
- "output mapping" is storing the subroutine results
- the "workflow output map" calculates the workflow results

---

# JCL: Loops

```
workflow whiletest:
in:
        input number
out:
        output number
do:
        while !v.thing or v.thing &lt; 10:
                call add:
                        counter = v.thing // a.input
                into:
                        thing = o.counter
wfomap:
        output = v.thing
```

Like all job state the while loop state is persistent.

---

# JCL: Ifs and such

```
workflow casetest:
in:
        input string
out:
        counter number
        thing string
wfomap:
        counter = v.counter
        thing = v.thing
do:
        case a.input:
        when "foo":
                call add:
                        counter = 10
                into:
                        counter = o.counter
                        thing = 'got foo'
        when bar, baz:
                eval:
                        counter = -1
                        thing = 'got bar or baz'
        else:
                eval:
                        counter = -1
                        thing = 'dunno what i got: ' .  a.input

```

# Implementation -  High level view

<img src="jobcenter big picture 2.svg" width="100%">

---

# Low level API

- the basis is a PostgreSQL stored procedure API:
  - create_job
  - get_job_status
  - announce
  - get_task
  - task_done
  - withdraw
- PostgreSQL listen/notify (pubsub) is used for ipc:
  - on creation of a new job
  - when a job finishes
  - when a task is ready for a worker
  - when a worker is done
  - etc.

---

# The Maestro

- keeps the time
  - timeouts
  - retries
- scheduling of periodic jobs (dead worker detection, archiving)
- tells the database what to do:
  - calls stored procedures on the first available connection:
      - in response to notifications
         - task ready / done / error / ping
      - based on the results of a query

---

# The JSON-RPC 2.0 API

- mostly a 1:1 translation of the low level api
- uses communication over establised connections
  - tcp / tls / websocket
  - multiple request can be "in flight" at the same time
  - asynchronous
  - notifications
- basically the same api for clients and workers
  - authentication handshake
  - a worker is a client that announces one or more actions
- the API calls the low level stored procedures "on behalf of" or
    "impersonating" the clients  and workers
- the API adds the concept of 'slots'
  - a worker can limit the amount of work it is being sent

---

# Implementation - Low level view

<img src="jobcenter postgresql processes.svg" width="90%">


---

# JobCenter::Pg

- a subclass of Mojo::Pg
  - adds a 'queue_query($cb)' method
  - calls that callback as soon as a database connection is available
  - the cb 'owns' that connection until it goes out of scope
  - allows a "at most _n_ connections" model
  - connections get closed after _max_use_ times
- this allows the Maestro to "play" on _n_ connections the same time
- this allows the jcapi to work "on behalf" of _n_ clients/workers at the same
time

---

# Low Level Example 1

```
# select * from create_job('calltest','{"input":123}'::jsonb);
 o_job_id | o_listenstring
----------+----------------
        9 | job:9:finished
```

Query done by the client.

`create_job`:
- verifies that the caller is allowed to call `calltest`
- verifies the input arguments against the specification
- inserts a record into the jobs table
- sends a `notify "jobtaskdone", '(5,3,9)'` to the Maestro
  - meaning: the 'start' task of this job has been done


---

# Low Level Example 2

```
# select * from do_jobtaskdone('(5,3,9)');
 error | jobtask 
-------+---------
 false | (5,2,9)
```

Query done by the Maestro on receipt of the notification.

`do_jobtaskdone`:
- finds the next task in the workflow
  - the next instruction in the program
- returns the "next thing to do":
  - (workflow_id, task_id, job_id)

???

Ignore the error = false for now

---


# Low Level Example 3

```
# select * from do_jobtask('(5,2,9)');
 error | jobtask 
-------+---------
 false | null
```

Query done by the Maestro.

`do_jobtask`:

- would return the "next thing to do"
  - keeping the workflow moving (program running)
- there is no next thing to do
  - because a worker needs to do the 'add' action first
- a `notify "action:1:ready", '{"job_id": 9}'` has been sent
  - alerting the worker

---

# Low Level Example 4

```
# select * from get_task('thisworker','add',9);
 o_job_id | o_job_cookie | o_in_args       | o_env 
----------+--------------+-----------------+-------
        9 | da3c5c5d     | {"counter":123} | null
```

Query done by the worker on receipt of the notification.

`get_task`:

- returns the "work to do" if there is any
  - maybe another worker was faster
- the cookie is unique for "this worker doing this task now"

---

# Low Level Example 5

```
# select task_done('da3c5c5d...', '{"counter":126}');
void
```

Query done by the worker when it has done it's work.

`task_done`:
- looks for the 'jobbask' using the cookie
- verifies the "output arguments" against the specification
- performs the output mapping
- stores the new value for the variables in the job record
- does a `NOTIFY "jobtaskdone", '(5,2,9)'`

---

# Low Level Example 6

```
# select * from do_jobtaskdone('(5,2,9)');
 error | jobtask 
-------+---------
 false | (5,4,9)
```

Query done by the Maestro on receipt of the notification.

`do_jobtaskdone`:
- finds the next task in the workflow

---

# Low Level Example 7

```
# select * from do_jobtask('(5,4,9)');
 error | jobtask 
-------+---------
 false | null
```

Query done by the Maestro.

Task_id 4 happens to be the "end task" for workflow_id 5:

- the workflow output map (wfomap) is executed
- the 'outargs' are checked against the workflow specification
- the 'outargs' are stored in the job record
- a `notify "job:9:finished", ''` is sent.

---

# Low Level Example 8

```
# select get_job_status(9);
 get_job_status  
-----------------
 {"output": 126}
```

Called by the client on receipt of the notifcation

`get_job_status`:
- returns the job results
  - or *null* if the job hasn't finished yet

---

# Secret Perl

- all expressions get compiled to perl
  - imap
  - omap
  - wfomap
  - if / while / repeat (bool)
  - case (string)
- executed in PostgreSQL using pl/perl


---


# So this :

```
workflow calltest:
in:
        input number
out:
        output number
wfomap:
        output = v.thing
do:
        call add:
                counter = a.input
                step = 3
        into:
                thing = o.counter
```

---

# Becomes this:


```
workflow calltest:
in:
        input number
out:
        output number
wfomap:
*        [[ $o{output} = $v{thing}; ]]
do:
        call add:
*                [[
*                $i{counter} = $a{input};
*                $i{step} = 3;
*                ]]
        into:
*                [[ $v{thing} = $o{counter}; ]]
```

---

# And is executed like this:

```perl
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION jobcenter.do_imap(code text, args jsonb, env jsonb, vars jsonb)
 RETURNS jsonb LANGUAGE plperl
AS $function$

use strict;
use warnings;
use JSON::MaybeXS qw(from_json to_json JSON);
use JobCenter::Safe;

my $safe = new JobCenter::Safe;
my ($code, $jargs, $jenv, $jvars) = @_;

our %a = %{from_json($jargs // '{}')};
our %e = %{from_json($jenv // '{}')};
our %v = %{from_json($jvars // '{}')};
our %i = ();
our $TRUE = JSON->true;
our $FALSE = JSON->false;
our $JSON = JSON::MaybeXS->new(utf8 => 0);

$safe->share(qw(%a %e %v %i $TRUE $FALSE $JSON));
$safe->reval($code, 1);

die "$@" if $@;
return to_json(\%i);

$function$
```

# Actual workflow example:

```
workflow "prov.vhost_event":
in:
	zone string
	zoneid integer
	vhost string
out:
	result boolean
	log string optional
*role:
	jobs_spooler
wfomap:
	&lt;result&gt;
	log = ifdef(v.log)
*locks:
        zoneid _ manual
        workflowlock 'prov.vhost_event'
do:
        `lock zoneid a.zoneid # lock zoneid`

        call provdb_get_rid_by_vhost:

                &lt;orderno&gt;
                &lt;clientid&gt;
```

---

## Actual workflow example 2:

```
        call dwh_vhost_event:
                &lt;rid&gt;
                &lt;orderno&gt;
                &lt;clientid&gt;
                zone = a.zone
                zoneid = a.zoneid
                vhost = a.vhost
        into:
                &lt;result&gt;
                v.postconfigure = ifdef(o.postconfigure)
                v.log = ifdef(o.comment)

        `if [[ $v{postconfigure} and $v{postconfigure} eq 'set_default_ip' ]]:`
                call provdb_update_zone_template:
                        zoneid = a.zoneid
                        template = 'strato-dwh-std'
                into:
                        &lt;result&gt;

                call 'prov.get_ip_list':

                        usage = 'DEFAULT_IP'
                into:
                        v.ips = o.array
```

---

## Actual workflow example 3:

```
                if [[ @{v{ips}} ]]:
                        call provdb_set_initial_ip:
                                zoneid = a.zoneid
                                &lt;ips&gt;
                        into:
                                &lt;result&gt;
                                v.log .= ifdef(o.log)

        # unlock
        unlock zoneid a.zoneid
        # done

```

---

# More features

- limits (steps/depth)
- error handling (try/catch)
- split/join multiple child jobs
- events

---

# Closely related: RPC-Switch

### JSON RPC 2.0 service composition

- workers connect to the RPC Switch offering methods
- a layer of method name mapping allows service composition
- clients 'consume' a service

### Jobcenter RPC-Switch bridge

- 'jcswitch'
  - uses the low level PG api
- can offer JC workflows as methods on the RPC-Switch
- can offer RPC-Switch methods as acions to the JC

---

# The JobCenter is small

- compared to other workflow engines
- about 6 kloc perl and 3.5 kloc sql
  - jcc is a big part of that
- runs quite well on a Raspberry Pi 3
  - bottle neck is io (tps)

---

# Todo

- documentation
  - better &amp; more
- better compiler (jcc):
  - not everything compiles that should compile
  - sensible error messages
  - change syntax?
  - rewrite in perl6?
- type checking for job-state variables
