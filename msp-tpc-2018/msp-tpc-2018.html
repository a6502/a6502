# Managing PostgreSQL stored procedures

# Why use stored procedures?

- no round trip time
  - especially useful if you have to "piece together" your data
- work with the database-native data-types
  - jsonb
- can be used to create a API-layer in the database
  - low overhead
  - known protocol
     - if you're already talking to the database



---

# Disadvantages of stored procedures

- they're "hidden in the database"
  - especially if you're not familiar with the database tooling
- difficult to manage


---

# Database Schema Management: Migrations

_the somewhat standard way_

- have migrations steps:
  - for one version up do this
     - alter table foo add column bar text
     - create index foo_bar_idx on foo(bar)
  - for one version down do that
     - alter table foo drop column bar
     - drop index foo_bar_idx

- crappy way to manage stored procedures
  - if stored procedures are part of your application
  - because code changes more rapidly than the schema

---

## Example: Mojo::Pg::Migrations

* Allows database schemas to evolve easily over time
* Uses 'migration files':
    * just a collection of sql statements
    * separated by comments of the form -- VERSION UP/DOWN
* Lets you migrate from any version to any version, up or down, in small
  steps
* Migrations are performed in transactions
    * 'Transactional DDL' is a PostgreSQL feature
* Locking is used to prevent multiple migrations running at the same time
    * important for the auto_migrate feature
* The current version is stored in the automatically created table
  'mojo_migrations'

---

## Example

(From perldoc Mojo::Pg::Migrations)

```sql

-- 1 up
create table messages (message text);
insert into messages values ('I â™¥ Mojolicious!');
-- 1 down
drop table messages;

-- 2 up (...you can comment freely here...)
create table stuff (whatever int);
-- 2 down
drop table stuff;


```

```
$db->migrations->from_file('migrations.sql')->migrate;

```

# Introducing: &lsquo;dbdings&rsquo;

"do something sensible with the database"

Why 'dbdings'?

* because we wanted to be able to version control stored procedures
    * one .sql file per stored procedure
        * so git/cvs can track version history nicely
    * 'standard' Edit-Compile-Run cycle
        * 'compile' -> 'load stored procedure'
* because the existing open source (Perl) database migration solutions
  that I could find do not have special handling of stored procedures
    * every change to a stored procedure is a schema upgrade
    * not a single file per procedure
* because I wanted something small and simple (KISS)

---

## How dbdings works (migration)

* on disk db/schema/.version contains the 'should' version
* in the database table _schema contains the 'is' version
* to go from version N to N+1 (upgrade):
    * execute db/schema/v{N+1}/alter.sql to upgrade
    * execute db/schema/v{N+1}/verify.sql to do checks
* to go from version N to N-1 (downgrade):
    * execute db/schema/v{N}/downgrade.sql to upgrade
    * execute db/schema/v{N-1}/verify.sql to do checks
* both scripts are executed in 1 transaction
    * using PostgreSQL's transactional DDL    
* dbdings can also create the schema from scratch
    * I'll skip over the details for now

---

## Example

db/schema/v8/alter.sql:

```sql
alter table jobs add column current_depth integer
    not null default 1;

alter table jobs_archive add column current_depth integer;
```

db/schema/v8/downgrade.sql:
```sql
alter table jobs drop column current_depth;

alter table jobs_archive drop column current_depth;
```

---

## Example cont'd

db/schema/v8/verify.sql:
```sql
DO $BODY$
BEGIN
        ASSERT (SELECT EXISTS(
                SELECT
                        true
                FROM
                        information_schema.columns
                WHERE
                        table_schema='jobcenter'
                        AND table_name='jobs'
                        AND column_name='current_depth'
        )), 'no column current_depth in table jobs??';
        ASSERT (SELECT EXISTS(
                SELECT
                        true
                FROM
                        information_schema.columns
                WHERE
                        table_schema='jobcenter'
                        AND table_name='jobs_archive'
                        AND column_name='current_depth'
        )), 'no column current_depth in table jobs_archive?';
        RAISE NOTICE 'all tests succesfull?';
END
$BODY$;
```

---

## Schema commands

* check:           check schema version in db and repo
* create:          create schema in db
* downgrade [ver]: try to downgrade db schema version to [ver]
* upgrade:         try to upgrade db schema version to repo version
* verify:          verify latest schema upgrade

---

## How dbdings works (stored procs)

* db/procs/*.sql is the 'should' situation
* table _procs contains the 'is' situation according to dbdings
    * md5sum of the function code
* 'dbding compare' detects
    * procedure changed on disk (only)
        * use 'dbdings load [proc]' to load into db
        * use 'dbding update' to load all changed procedures
    * procedure changed in db (only)
        * maybe changed by psql's '\ef [proc]'.
        * use 'dbdings save [proc]' to save to disk
        * refuse to overwrite with 'update'
        * may overwrite with 'load'
    * procedure changed both on disk and in db
        * panic!
        * user needs to decide what needs to be done
    

---

# Stored procedures commands

* compare:         compare version between db and repo
* load &lt;proc&gt;:     load &lt;proc&gt; from repo into db
* save &lt;proc&gt;:     save &lt;proc&gt; from db to repo
* update:          update procs in db from repo


---

## Possible enhancements

* Current status 'It Works For Me' &trade;

* Better integration with git?
    * record git commit hash somewhere?
    * 'downgrade' also downgrades checkout?
    * do upgrades/downgrades 1 step at a time
        * makes it easier to delete things

* Locking like Mojo::Pg?
    
---

## Possible future work

* Turn it into a seperate standalone tool?

* Support for other databases?
    * Needs a way to do a md5sum of the proc in the db
