about strato?

---

## The problem:

- lots of different systems by different departments
- most of them need to talk to each other
  - almost a fully connected mesh
- using various protocols
  - some home-grown

---

## The (beginning of a) solution:

- try to migrate to one protocol
- try to introduce "API aggregation points"
  - a.k.a. service-composition

---

## What is service-composition?

Piecing together various (micro)services to form a larger service.

(Hopefully with a coherent API)

---

## TMTOWTDI

- service discovery
- middle man a.k.a. proxy a.k.a. API Gateway
- etc.?

## <strike>Service Switchboard</strike>
## RPC-Switch

- Clients connect to the RPC-Switch and call methods
- Workers connect to the RPC-Switch and 'announce' methods
- A worker is a client
- The RPC-Switch rewrites and forwards requests (methods calls)
  - after checking ACL
  - optionally after validating per request authentication  
- The RPC-Switch forwards responses

???

Naming things is hard

---

## Twoway JSON-RPC 2.0 over 'NetstringStream'

Long lived tcp or ssl connection with netstrings as a framing mechanism:

```json
86:{"jsonrpc":"2.0","params":{},"method":"rpcswitch.ping","id":"ZpnvECEhLRBpzTy9evMIuQ"},
```

- asynchronous

- unlimited amount of requests 'in flight' on a single connection

- overtaking allowed

- both sides can send requests (or notifications)

???

- https://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt

- https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification

- MojoX::NetstringStream

---

## Request rewriting

- method namespace mapping
- add authentication information
- add 'virtual channel' information

---

## Request rewriting example

input from client:

```json
{
  "id":"kYxd0/eZJkOm+Iu6kVNmZA",
  "params":{"step":3,"counter":12},
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "method":"foo.add"
}
```

output to worker:

```json
{
  "params":{"step":3,"counter":12},
  "id":"kYxd0/eZJkOm+Iu6kVNmZA",
  "method":"bar.add",
  "rpcswitch":{"vcookie":"eatme","vci":"1734@12098<->2@12099","who":"theCustomer"},
  "jsonrpc":"2.0"
}
```

---

## Response forwarding

- The RPC-Switch looks at the virtual channel information
- The worker (client) library needs to know about the extra information
- Multiple responses are allowed
  - The extra responses become notifications on the virtual channel


---

## Response example

first response from worker:

```json
{
  "id":"kYxd0/eZJkOm+Iu6kVNmZA",
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "rpcswitch":{..."worker_id":"2@12099","vci":"1734@12098<->2@12099"},
  "result":["RES_WAIT","kYxd0/eZJkOm+Iu6kVNmZA"]
}
```

second response from worker:

```json
{
  "method":"rpcswitch.result",
  "params":["RES_OK","kYxd0/eZJkOm+Iu6kVNmZA",{"counter":15}],
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "rpcswitch":{...,"worker_id":"2@12099","vci":"1734@12098<->2@12099"}
}
```

---

## Implementation details

version 1
- 1.5 kloc
- based on Mojo::IOLoop::Server
- single process
- MojoX::NetstringStream
- JSON::RPC2::TwoWay
- RPC::Switch::Client
  - a worker is a client
  - and clients in c, js, java
  - todo: python (real soon now), perl6
  
---

## Implementation details cont'd

version 2:
- compatible to version 1
- 3 kloc
- now multiprocess
- shares as litlle as possible between processes
  - LMDB_File for shared information
  - POSIX::RT::MQ for interprocess communication


---

## RPC-Switch pros and cons

pro:
- one well-known point to connect to
- outgoing connections is easier with our admins
- one place for the global configuration

con:
- one single point of failure (currently)
- dependency on the RPC-Switch operators

# Thank You!

???

Once upon a time there was this company

started small, as a reseller

and grew and grew
more products
more departments
more systems

and most of them need to talk to each other

a fully connected mesh?
or a mess?

wouldn't it be nice if clients can connect to a switchboard and just 'dial' the service they want?

the idea: a central service switchboard

'workers' connect to the switchboard and announce methods

the central switchboard configuration manages:
- namespace mapping
- authentication
- access control (for clients and servers)
- basic documentation (blame allocation)

clients connect to the switchboard and call methods
they don't care which worker is doing this

Twoway JSON-RPC 2.0 over NetstringStream:
- a long lived tcp or ssl connection
- netstrings for framing
- both sides may send requests

This allows for:
- multiple in-flight requests on the connection
- overtaking is allowed
- multiple responses (with a little trick)
- i'll do this, i'll call you when it's done

Virtual channels:
so the workers now which client it is working for
the rpcswitch 'enriches' the request with authentication information
- per request
